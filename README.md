## ❓ 〢 About
⚙️ ZagreuS is an obscure closed-source ransomware builder known as 'ESCANOR' and 'Red3v1l'.    
It encrypts every file with AES-RSA and comes with several malicious toggleable features.    
  
🧰 The binaries code has been decompiled and fixed to its original state, making it moddable.    
Because of that, you no longer need to pay the author to get any kind of source/build.  

🛠️ Times work, a few hours to fix damaged designer code and restore original states/functions.  
I did not bother to restore the original GUI, I left an old cracked versions GUI instead.
